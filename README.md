##### Change of thinking, a manifesto
##### A Composable Philosophy
---
A manifesto is defined as a declaration of one’s beliefs, opinions, motives, and intentions. It is simply a document that an organization or person writes that declares what is important to them.

##### Goals
1. Convince others to adopt the philosophy of changing ones mind regularly
2. Embrace the discovering of ones  

##### Non Goals
1. Statement about objective truth
2. Moral framework


# Axiom
Our universe is so vast in time, space, complexity, and scale that it is mostly unknowable. Ones mind will only experience an infinitesimal point in history, location, ideas, and perspective over a lifetime.


# Lemma
---
Knowing this we can conclude that whatever is in ones mind will have errors and need adaptation / iteration


# Theorem
---
##### Each mind is a self contained ecosystem or framework
1. Others must necessarily think differently than oneself based on the amount of information and variation in environment and experience

What prevents people from changing their mind?

Remove the shame / stigma / fear around
1. Changing ones mind
2. Errors / Mistakes
3. Thinking differently than your local group

Detaching ideas from identity (identity is just that one is not sure and ideas change)

Expert Knowledge
- The deeper an understanding of a topic the more one realizes how little was known before. This pattern is repeated endlessly and should be assumed as the default state of knowledge. Unless one has done original research or investigation assume nothing.


# Method / Application
---
Categories of knowledge
1. Provable system Axiom -> Lemma -> Theorem
2. Original research / investigation
3. Expert understanding formal training
4. Information from a peer reviewed reproducible system
5. A Belief

When thinking about or discussing an idea
1. identify the category of knowledge one is working from. The categories are not intended to demean any other, only to make explicit
2. divide the idea into many smallest part that can stand on their own and think about them individually

# Call to Action

# FAQ
---
1. (Q) How is this different than science. (A) Science is a process of hypothesis and experimentation to build a model of objective reality. This philosophy simply argues that changing ones mind should be practiced and encouraged without fear.
