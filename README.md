# Soft Thinking
Written to organize thoughts on states of mind. Specifically the state that our models of reality are transitory and changed by observation. Soft Thinking is the state of continuous curiosity without resistance.

##### Definitions
_Model_: describes the details of state structures and transition functions

_Axiom_: A premise or starting point of reasoning. As classically conceived, an axiom is a premise so evident as to be accepted as true without controversy.

_Lemma_: A proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement of interest by itself

_Theorem_: A statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theoremsâ€”and generally accepted statements, such as axioms

##### Goals
1. Convince others to adopt the philosophy of changing ones mind regularly
2. Embrace the discovering of inconsistencies and faults of ones internal mental model
3. Learn to crave the struggle for new ideas and the moment just before understanding over the feeling of being "right".
4. Encourage a method of debate that moves away from winning an argument to one of understand others point of view. Perhaps one will adopt it in the future.
5. Detaching ideas from identity. Instead build ones identity around the idea that a changing of mind is unavoidable and even desirable.
6. View all ideas as part of a web of information. Others will never be at all of the same points at the same time. Instead of looking down on others for holding different ideas, remember the journey along paths of the web and how far ones own mind had to travel.
7. To be a composable philosophy, easily attached or included with other philosophies.
8. Remove the shame and fear of admitting to holding an idea that is later found to be incorrect.

##### Non Goals
1. Statement about objective truth
2. Moral framework
3. Promotion of any other particular creed, philosophy or religion.

# Narrative

Our universe is vast in time, space, complexity, and scale. So vast that it is mostly unknowable. Ones mind will only experience an infinitesimal point in history, location, ideas, and perspective over a lifetime.

Many organisms and systems are composed of countless actors each operating independently and unexpectedly. Even with our most advanced models we can only make generalizations about the behavior of these systems at large scales. Often we must ignore the details to make any kind of prediction or decision.

Accepting this we can conclude that whatever is in any individual mind will have errors, biases and need adaptation or iteration. Additionally one cannot see what is in another mind and so each mind should be view as a kind of island. Others must necessarily think differently based on exposure to information and personal variation in environment and experience.

The deeper an understanding of a topic the more one realizes how little was known before. This pattern is repeated endlessly and should be assumed as the default state of knowledge. Unless one has done original research or investigation assume nothing.

##### What prevents people from changing their mind?
1. Social Bonds
2. Identity
3. Physiology
4. Fear
5. Shame

##### Remove the shame / stigma / fear around
1. Changing ones mind
2. Errors / Mistakes
3. Thinking differently than your local group


# Method of Application
##### Categories of knowledge
1. Provable system Axiom -> Lemma -> Theorem
2. Original research / investigation
3. Expert understanding formal training
4. Information from a peer reviewed reproducible system
5. A Belief

##### When thinking about or discussing an idea
1. identify the category of knowledge one is working from. The categories are not intended to demean any other, only to make explicit
2. divide the idea into many smallest part that can stand on their own and think about them individually

# Call to Action
##### The change of thinking website.
1. Post the idea that changed your own mind about any topic
2. Post the best argument for or against any topic
3. Posting gives points to spend voting on other post to promote them to the top of search results

# FAQ
1. (Q) How is this different than science. (A) Science is a process of hypothesis and experimentation to build a model of objective reality. This philosophy simply argues that changing ones mind should be practiced and encouraged without fear.
