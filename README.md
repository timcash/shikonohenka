Change of thinking, a manifesto
Composable Philosophy

A manifesto is defined as a declaration of one’s beliefs, opinions, motives, and intentions. It is simply a document that an organization or person writes that declares what is important to them.

Non Goals
    1.) statement about objective truth
    2.) moral framework

# Axiom

Our universe is vast and mostly unknowable

Information is lost to history and the distance of space

# Lemma

Knowing this we can conclude that whatever is in ones mind will have errors and need adaptation / iteration

# Therom

Each mind is a self contained ecosystem or framework
    - Others must necessarily think differently than oneself based on the amount of information and variation in environment / experience
    - Richard Feynman time tracking experiment

What prevents people from changing their mind?

Remove the shame / stigma / fear around
    - Changing ones mind
    - Errors / Mistakes
    - Thinking differently than your local group

Detaching ideas from identity (identity is just that one is not sure and ideas change)

Expert Knowledge
    The deeper an understanding of a topic the more one realizes how little was known before. This pattern is repeated endlessly and should be assumed as the default state of knowledge. Unless one has done original research / investigate assume nothing.

# Method / Application

Categories of knowledge
    1.) Provable system Axiom -> Lemma -> Theorem
    2.) Original research / investigation
    3.) Expert understanding formal training
    4.) Information from a peer reviewed reproducible system
    5.) A Belief

When thinking about or discussing an idea
    1.) identify the category of knowledge one is working from. The categories are not intended to demean any other, only to make explicit
    2.) divide the idea into many smallest part that can stand on their own and think about them individually
