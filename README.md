Change of thinking manifesto

Our universe is vast and mostly unknowable
Information is lost to history and the distance of space
Knowing this we can conclude that whatever is in ones mind will have errors
Each mind is a self contained ecosystem or framework
    - Others must necessarily think differently than oneself based on the amount of information and variation in environment / experience
    - Richard Feynman time tracking experiment
